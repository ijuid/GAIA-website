   <h1>Who are we</h1>
   <p>GAIA helps highlight global environmental issues that pose an immediate threat or danger to ecosystems throughout the world and suggest solutions or courses of action by the general public as well as companies and governments.
   </p>
   <p>
     GAIA aims to promote awareness and education about the impacts of climate change and also the impacts of litter/plastic</p>
   <p>GAIA connects cutting-edge conservation science with the collective power of our partners in the field, more than 1.3 million supporters in the United States and 5 million globally, and our partnerships with communities, companies, and governments.</p> 

   <p>GAIA’s work has evolved from saving species and landscapes to addressing the larger global threats and forces that impact them. Recognizing that the problems facing our planet are increasingly more complex and urgent, we have refined the way in which we work around an ambitious new strategy. Our new strategy puts people at the center and organizes our work around 4 key areas: forests, Seas, Weather and Activism. By linking these 4 areas in an integrated approach, we can better leverage our unique assets and direct all our resources to protecting vulnerable places, species and communities worldwide.
     </p>
     <p>People are at the center of our work because together we can change the trajectory of the threats to nature, and help ensure nature’s ability to provide—for the sake of every living thing, including ourselves. Together, we can protect the planet and restore the health and quality of life for all</p>
